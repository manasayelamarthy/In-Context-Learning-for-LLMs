# Multi-Docs ChatBot using Gemini 2.0 Flash (RAG)

## About the Project
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built using LangChain, Streamlit, and Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash model. It allows users to upload a document (PDF, Markdown, or TXT), extracts its content, and provides intelligent, context-based answers using Gemini LLM. It supports both text and voice input for seamless interaction.

## Deployed Application
The app is deployed with Streamlit and accessible at:

## Dataset Details
There is no preloaded dataset in this project.

- Users upload their own documents at runtime.
- Supported file types: `.pdf`, `.md`, `.txt`
- Documents are converted (PDF to Markdown when necessary), embedded using vector stores, and queried via LangChain retrievers.

## Model Details
The project uses the following core components:

- **LLM:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (via `langchain_google_genai`)
- **Prompt Format:**
  ```text
  You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
  Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer
  the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you
  don't know. DON'T MAKE UP ANYTHING.

  {context}

  ---
