# In-Context-Learning LLMs

## About the Project
This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that allows users to upload documents (PDF, Markdown, or TXT), extracts the content, and answers user queries based on the uploaded document. It uses **Gemini 2.0 Flash** as the language model, powered by **LangChain**, and the interface is built using **Streamlit**. Voice input is also supported using WebRTC and Google Speech Recognition.

## Deployed Application
The frontend and backend are built using **Streamlit** and deployed at:

It was a local host link 

ðŸ‘‰ [**Live Demo**](https://localhost:8501/) 


## Dataset Details
There is no fixed dataset used in this project. Instead:
- Users upload their own documents at runtime.
- Supported file types:
  - `.pdf`
  - `.md` (Markdown)
  - `.txt`
- PDF files are converted to Markdown using the **Marker** library.
- Uploaded content is embedded using **LangChain's** vector store and used for context retrieval during question answering.

## Model Details
The application uses the following architecture and tools:

- **LLM:** [Gemini 2.0 Flash](https://ai.google.dev/)
  - Accessed via `langchain_google_genai`
- **RAG Pipeline:** LangChain retriever + Chat prompt + Gemini model
- **Voice Input:** `streamlit_webrtc` and `speech_recognition`
- **PDF to Markdown Conversion:** Marker library
- **Prompt Template:**
  ```text
  You are an assistant for question-answering tasks.
  Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer
  the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you
  don't know. DON'T MAKE UP ANYTHING.
